# Known issues

## Launcher and Common
Please see the [wsldl document](https://git.io/wsldl-doc).

## glibc
The default glibc is optimized for the new kernel and uses syscall, which is not implemented in WSL1.

If you don't use glibc with a patch that isn't the mainline, your instance won't start.

You can use `glibc-linux4`[ᴬᵁᴿ](https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/glibc-linux4) package instead.

You can install from archlinuxcn community repository (can auto-update, recommend)
```
echo '[archlinuxcn]
Server = https://repo.archlinuxcn.org/$arch' >> /etc/pacman.conf
sudo pacman -Syy && sudo pacman -S archlinuxcn-keyring && sudo pacman -S glibc-linux4
```
or you can install from AUR helper
```
yay -S glibc-linux4
```

## fakeroot
fakeroot is using SYSV IPC by default.
but WSL1 does not support it now.

You can use `fakeroot-tcp`[ᴬᵁᴿ](https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/fakeroot-tcp/) package instead. (WSL2 doesn't require that)

Download [fakeroot-tcp-1.23-1-x86_64.pkg.tar.xz](https://github.com/yuk7/arch-prebuilt/releases/download/18082100/fakeroot-tcp-1.23-1-x86_64.pkg.tar.xz) and run ```pacman -U fakeroot-tcp-1.23-1-x86_64.pkg.tar.xz``` to install.

## Qt5
qt >=5.10 library doesn't work in WSL1. This is an issue with WSL.(Please see [Microsoft/WSL#3023](https://github.com/Microsoft/WSL/issues/3023))

Please execute this line on root:
```strip --remove-section=.note.ABI-tag /usr/lib/libQt5Core.so.5```

## MySQL 8/MariaDB
MySQL >=8 uses the native AIO interface by default. WSL1 does not support it, so you need to configure it.
Edit /etc/my.cnf.d/server.cnf for add `innodb_use_native_aio=0` to `[mysqld]` section.
```
[mysqld]
innodb_use_native_aio=0
```

## D-Bus
Systemd D-Bus daemon doesn't work in WSL1.
We recommend using `dbus-x11`[ᴬᵁᴿ](https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/dbus-x11/).
Download [dbus-x11-1.12.16-1-x86_64.pkg.tar.xz](https://github.com/yuk7/arch-prebuilt/releases/download/20051200/dbus-x11-1.12.16-1-x86_64.pkg.tar.xz) and run ```pacman -U dbus-x11-1.12.16-1-x86_64.pkg.tar.xz``` to install.

For start D-Bus daemon, run:
```
sudo mkdir /run/dbus -p
sudo dbus-daemon --system
```

## systemd/systemctl

If you're using WSL 0.67.6 and above (see `wsl --version`), systemd is natively supported. To enable it, edit `/etc/wsl.conf` and then restart the distro.
```
[boot]
systemd=true
```

If you're using an older version of WSL, we recommend using a systemctl alternative script or bottle for apps that require it.

### WSL1 / WSL2
You can use a systemctl alternative script.
However, this is only partially compatible.

Download [systemd-altctl-1.4.4181-2-any.pkg.tar.xz](https://github.com/yuk7/arch-systemctl-alt/releases/download/1.4.4181-2/systemd-altctl-1.4.4181-2-any.pkg.tar.xz) and run ```pacman -U systemd-altctl-1.4.4181-2-any.pkg.tar.xz``` to install. Remember to check [the releases page](https://github.com/yuk7/arch-systemctl-alt/releases) for a newer version.

### WSL2
You can use systemd bottle "[subsystemctl](https://github.com/sorah/subsystemctl)", "[genie](https://github.com/arkane-systems/genie)", "[wsl-distrod](https://github.com/nullpo-head/wsl-distrod)" or "[bottled-shell](https://github.com/lungothrin/bottled-shell)".

Using any of the aformentioned solutions, will allow you to run systemd completely.

#### subsystemctl
You can download [PKGBUILD](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/sorah/arch.sorah.jp/master/aur-sorah/PKGBUILDs/subsystemctl/PKGBUILD) and build it.

[See here for how to use it.](https://github.com/sorah/subsystemctl#usage)

#### genie
You can use [PKGBUILDs from here](https://gist.github.com/arlllk/7001c521de601f01735af5ca440f03ae).

[See here for how to use it.](https://github.com/arkane-systems/genie#usage)

#### Intel Graphics

ArchWSL may not properly load the Intel WSL driver by default, which will make it impossible to use the D3D12 driver on Intel graphics cards.

The cause of this problem is that the Intel WSL driver files link against libraries that do not exist on ArchLinux, you can manually fix them to make it work.

You need to use `ldd` to see which libraries they are linked with, eg: `ldd /usr/lib/wsl/drivers/iigd_dch_d.inf_amd64_49b17bc90a910771/*.so`, and then look for libraries marked `not found`. Then check whether there are corresponding packages in the ArchLinux package repository. If so, install them, and the problem may be solved. If you cannot find the corresponding library file in the software package warehouse, it may be that the version suffix of the library file is different, such as `libedit.so.0.0.68` and `libedit.so.2`, then you can try to It creates a soft link to the existing version.
